# About (Development)

During the Setup chapter we touched a bit on development for this project. First of all, this site is NOT a single page application. Each "route" is literally its own html page. We also established developing in Typescript for scripting and SASS for stylesheets. We also established a little bit of source code structure. We decided that everything we'll develop will go inside the `/src` folder. The `/src` folder will contain our html pages, their corresponding JS files. In the `/src` folder, we have the `/assets` folder where we'll keep images we'll eventually deploy, and `/scss` to store the SASS files.

Throughout this chapter, we will expand on the project structure we have so far as well as establish practices and implement some framework-less and library-less techonologies. Inevitably, we'll review some old-school Web API
