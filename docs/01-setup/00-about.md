# About

This is my attempt to create a public-facing modern website without the use of MVVM frameworks such as React, Vue, Ember, etc., and without UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Material.

Why am I doing this? It is for a personal challenge and it may have performance benefits once deployed.

In a nutshell, I will develop in a modern way, using Typescript for the code, SCSS for styles, and plain HTML to render the pages. In the end, the outputted files SHOULD be a set of files that will render on pages.

## Level 0

I will need to use Webpack for this project because it puts things together much easier than Gulp or Grunt.

At first, I'll set up HTML and SCSS and have a few pages. I hope to get webpack to serve these, as well as set up a live server that will output what I've created on the browser and would change when anything changes.

## Level 1

I'll add Typescript and create a script file for each page.

## Level 2

Image Optimization and loading.

## Next Levels

I don't know at this point. I'll get there. These levels may include testing, local storage, widgets like modal popups, etc.
